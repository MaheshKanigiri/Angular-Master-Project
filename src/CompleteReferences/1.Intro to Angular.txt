### 1. Introduction to Angular

#### What is Angular?
  Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
  It is developed and maintained by Google.
  Angular provides a robust structure for building large-scale applications and offers a range of features
  like declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices.

#### Key Features
- **Component-based Architecture**: Angular applications are built with components, which are the building blocks of the UI.
- **Two-way Data Binding**: Syncs data between model and view, reducing the need for boilerplate code.
- **Dependency Injection**: Improves code modularity and testing.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with new syntax and capabilities.
- **Services**: Share data and logic across components.
- **Routing**: Manage navigation between views.
- **Forms Handling**: Robust support for building forms with validation.
- **HTTP Client**: Communicate with backend services.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive support for unit testing and end-to-end testing.

#### Angular vs. Other Frameworks
- **React**: Angular is a complete framework with built-in features like routing and form handling,
whereas React is a library focused on building UIs,
requiring additional libraries for these features.
- **Vue.js**: Vue is easier to learn and integrate with existing projects,
while Angular is more suitable for building large-scale applications with a well-defined structure.
- **Svelte**: Svelte compiles components into efficient imperative code that directly
manipulates the DOM, while Angular uses a virtual DOM and change detection mechanism.

#### Setting up the Development Environment
1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Angular requires Node.js and npm. Download and install them
from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install Angular CLI**: Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
3. **Create a New Angular Project**:
   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up the project.
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd my-angular-app
   ng serve
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to see the default Angular app.
